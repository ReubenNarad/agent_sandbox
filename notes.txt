- always allow doesnt really work?
- I get "working" but why "waiting for logs..."?      <- could use separator between the two
- [Working core::codex] message. The :: syntax looks rusty, most ppl don't know rust. Should the user see that?
- I like auto compact 🤷‍♂️
- I want /continue
- I want to paste images
- codex mini runs out of context fast! Model limitation?
- ctrl + j newline is unusual...?
